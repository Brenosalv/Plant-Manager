# Plant Manager

Plant Manager is a multiplataform (Android and iOS) mobile app for people who want to manage plants in different places of their home. It says when you should water the plants and notificate it. Also, it has info about several plants, which help users to take care of the plants.

The app was developed with React Native, Expo and Typescript technologies.

It was my first mobile app developed ever.
